# Database-agnostic keyword searching handler
#
# Keywords have the format keyword:value
# Keywords can also be negated with -, as in -keyword:value
# Values are comma-separated, while keywords are space-separated
# See https://github.com/bruce/keyword_search for more information
#
# Subclasses must set the search_routine class variable,
# as well as the authorized? method
#
# Required:
#
#   search_routine - the Lev::Routine that will handle the search
#
# Optional (recommended to prevent scraping):
#
#   min_characters - the minimum number of characters allowed in the query
#                    only an error will be returned if the query has less
#                    than the minimum number of characters allowed
#                    default: nil (disabled)
#
#   max_items - the maximum number of matching items allowed to be returned
#               no results will be returned if this number is exceeded,
#               but the total result count will still be returned
#               applies even if pagination is enabled
#               default: nil (disabled)
#
# This handler expects the following parameters from the user or the UI:
#
# Required:
#
#   q - the query itself, a String that follows the keyword format above
#
# Optional:
#
#   order_by - a String used to order the search results - default: 'created_at ASC'
#   per_page - the number of results returned per page - default: nil (disabled)
#   page     - the current page number - default: 1
#
# This handler's output contains:
#
#   outputs[:total_count] - the total number of items that matched the query
#                           set even when no results are returned due to
#                           a query that is too short or too generic
#   outputs[:items]       - the array of objects returned by the search routine
#
# See spec/dummy/app/handlers/users_search.rb for an example search handler
